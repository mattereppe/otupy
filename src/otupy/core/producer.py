		OpenC2 Producer

		An OpenC2 Producer sends Commands and receives Responses. The `Producer` is an intermediary to 
		deal with OpenC2-related issues, but does not implement any control logic. A `Producer` instance
		is used to create an OpenC2 stack with an `Encoder` and a `Transfer` protocol. The `Producer`
		is associated to an identifier to distinguish its messages.	

		Note that the actuator instance is only known to the consumer, which runs it. The producer 
		 knows the profile of the actuator, which embeds the an identifier for the actual
		 actuator run by the consumer.
